# TF summarize

**The concern is:** I have a lot of changes in terraform and I need a clear way of the concepts that are going to be **deleted|changed|created** only with the resource address. It can be messy to have a super tf plan output when there are **many changes**.


## Example

Imagine you are going to:

- Create a new s3 test bucket
- Change your ALB ingress controller policy and vpc-cni addon
- Delete grafana backup tool helm chart

## Steps

1. Makes the appropriate changes from code.

2. Execute `tfsum terraform`, then you will see the original output of a plan/apply and a summary only printing the resource addr and the action.

> tfsum is a custom function. See [usage](#usage) or [tfsum.sh](scripts/tfsum.sh)

![tfsum](assets/example.png)

*This summarized output can be useful, for example, for:*

* You are migrating a terraform module and there are many changes that may be important in terms of destroying/creating resources (e.g., if you are migrating an EKS module from v17.X to v19.X).
* You use GitOps and deploy terraform from pipeline. The pipeline that makes the `terraform plan` can always show a summary of what is going to change (instead of having a super output of the original terraform plan).

# Installation

## Quick installation (latest version)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerscrew/tftools/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Take a look inside docs [install](./docs/install.md)

# Usage

Take a look inside docs [usage](./docs/usage.md)

## Built-in subcommand

`tfsum usage` is subcommand that prints the contents of [usage.md](docs/usage.md) in pretty terminal markdown render

```bash
tftools usage
```

> Requires internet connectivity, as it fetches the [usage.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerscrew/tftools/main/docs/usage.md) file.

# TO DO

* Improve error handling
* Create generic `install.sh`
* Add tests, although I have no experience
* Code refactor is certainly needed!

# Contribution

Pull requests are welcome! Any code refactoring, improvement, implementation.
